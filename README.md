✨ Hie everyone, so here is a spot that will showcase a little bit about me! Let’s dive straight in:  

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on**: Crafting some awesome HTML forms (yes, I found so much fun in them—just wanna do them over and over again).  
- 🌱 **At the moment, I am learning**: Some CSS—love to style, and styling is my style!  
- 👯 **Tweaks and turns**: I am looking to collaborate on anything CSS-related, especially layouts, Grid, and Flex united.  
- 🤔 **Sending an SOS to**: CSS grids, animations, and those annoying media queries that refuse to cooperate.  
- 💬 **Ask me about**: My love for playing music 🎸 or my instinct for fixing computers 💻. Seriously, I’m your tech guy!

- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I love eating fish, cycling 🚴, karate 🥋, and attending kickboxing lessons online to never practice.
